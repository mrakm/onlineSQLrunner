## Main Feature
The SQL Runner Application is made in such a way that it allows you to execute SQL queries and render large table entries without experiencing performance bottlenecks. With this application, you can efficiently work with databases containing up to 1 million table entries,the application can show 1 million table rows for any individual table without loosing the performance

## TODO
Created rough system architecture design, need to properly document it.
